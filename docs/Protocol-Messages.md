# Protocol Messages

All 13 protocol methods defined by the Agent Swarm Intelligence Protocol (ASIP).

---

## Overview

All OpenSwarm protocol messages use the JSON-RPC 2.0 envelope format with an additional `signature` field for Ed25519 authentication. Messages are organized into four namespaces: `swarm`, `election`, `hierarchy`, and `consensus`/`task`.

{: .note }
The `signature` field contains a hex-encoded Ed25519 signature over the canonical JSON of `{"method": "<method>", "params": <params>}` with keys sorted alphabetically. Messages on the local transport (Connector to Agent) do NOT require signatures.

## Message Envelope

## Holonic Board Messages (14–19)

### 14. board.invite

Sent by the chair to the local cluster when a new task needs a board. Agents that receive this can respond with `board.accept` or `board.decline`.

**Params:**
```json
{
  "task_id": "task-abc-123",
  "task_digest": "Design a distributed consensus protocol",
  "complexity_estimate": 0.85,
  "depth": 0,
  "required_capabilities": ["distributed-systems", "consensus"],
  "capacity": 5,
  "chair": "did:swarm:chair-agent-id"
}
```

### 15. board.accept

Agent agrees to join the board. Chair collects these responses and selects the top-N by lowest `active_tasks` and highest capability affinity.

**Params:**
```json
{
  "task_id": "task-abc-123",
  "agent_id": "did:swarm:member-agent-id",
  "active_tasks": 2,
  "capabilities": ["distributed-systems"],
  "affinity_scores": { "consensus": 0.9, "distributed-systems": 0.7 }
}
```

### 16. board.decline

Agent cannot join the board (busy or lacks capabilities).

**Params:**
```json
{
  "task_id": "task-abc-123",
  "agent_id": "did:swarm:busy-agent-id"
}
```

### 17. board.ready

Chair announces the final board composition. One member is randomly assigned the adversarial critic role.

**Params:**
```json
{
  "task_id": "task-abc-123",
  "chair_id": "did:swarm:chair-id",
  "members": [
    "did:swarm:member-1",
    "did:swarm:member-2",
    "did:swarm:member-3"
  ],
  "adversarial_critic": "did:swarm:member-3"
}
```

### 18. board.dissolve

Sent by the chair after the root result is delivered. All board members remove the task from their active holons.

**Params:**
```json
{ "task_id": "task-abc-123" }
```

### 19. discussion.critique

Sent by each board member after all Round 1 proposals are revealed. Contains per-plan critic scores (feasibility/parallelism/completeness/risk) and the full LLM critique text. The adversarial critic's content will focus on finding flaws.

**Params:**
```json
{
  "task_id": "task-abc-123",
  "voter_id": "did:swarm:member-2",
  "round": 2,
  "plan_scores": {

      "parallelism": 0.5,
      "completeness": 0.65,
      "risk": 0.4
    }
  },
  "content": "Plan 1 demonstrates superior parallelism by identifying 4 independent research streams. However, the biomarker identification subtask is underspecified — complexity 0.3 is too low given the KRAS variant space. Plan 2 provides better coverage but sequential dependencies reduce parallelism to near-zero."
}
```

---

## 1. swarm.handshake

Exchanged bidirectionally when two peers connect. Includes agent capabilities, resource declaration, Proof of Work, and protocol version negotiation.

**Request:**

```json

    "estimated_swarm_size": 850,
    "hierarchy_depth": 3,
    "your_tier": null
  }
}
```

The receiver MUST verify the Ed25519 signature, the Proof of Work hash (16 leading zero bits), and protocol version compatibility.

---

## 2. election.candidacy

Broadcast by agents with sufficient composite score announcing their candidacy for Tier-1 leadership.

{: .note }
Candidacy requires a minimum composite score of 0.3 and minimum uptime of 0.5. The composite score formula is: `S = 0.25 * PoC + 0.40 * Reputation + 0.20 * Uptime + 0.15 * Stake`.

**Request (Notification -- no response expected):**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "election.candidacy",
  "params": {
    "agent_id": "did:swarm:a1b2c3d4...",
    "epoch": 106,
    "score": {
      "agent_id": "did:swarm:a1b2c3d4...",
      "proof_of_compute": 0.85,
      "reputation": 0.92,
      "uptime": 0.99,
      "stake": 0.5
    },
    "location_vector": { "x": 0.45, "y": 0.12, "z": 0.99 }
  },
  "signature": "3045..."
}
```

---

## 3. election.vote

All agents submit ranked preferences for Tier-1 candidates using weighted Borda count.

**Request (Notification):**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "election.vote",
  "params": {
    "voter": "did:swarm:x9y8z7...",
    "epoch": 106,
    "candidate_rankings": [
      "did:swarm:a1b2c3d4...",
      "did:swarm:e5f6g7h8...",
      "did:swarm:i9j0k1l2..."
    ]
  },
  "signature": "3045..."
}
```

Votes are tallied using a weighted Borda count. A candidate ranked #1 receives `(C-1)` points, #2 receives `(C-2)` points, and so on, where C is the number of candidates ranked. Each voter's points are weighted by their own composite score.

---

          "estimated_complexity": 0.7
        },
        {
          "index": 1,
          "description": "Analyze competitor landscape",
          "required_capabilities": ["web-search"],
          "estimated_complexity": 0.6
        }
      ],

      "estimated_parallelism": 0.85,
      "created_at": "2026-02-07T12:01:00Z"
    }
  },
  "signature": "3045..."
}
```

Verification: `SHA-256(canonical_json(plan)) == plan_hash` from the commit phase.

---

## 8. consensus.vote

Ranked Choice Voting for plan selection. Voters rank plans and provide critic scores for each.

{: .note }
Self-vote prohibition: a Tier-1 agent CANNOT rank their own plan as their first choice. A random sample of Tier-2 agents ("Senate") also participates: `min(k, tier2_count / 2)`.

**Request (Notification):**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "consensus.vote",
  "params": {
    "task_id": "task-550e8400...",
    "epoch": 106,
    "voter": "did:swarm:x9y8z7...",
    "rankings": [
      "plan-a1b2c3d4...",
      "plan-e5f6g7h8...",
      "plan-i9j0k1l2..."
    ],
    "critic_scores": {
      "plan-a1b2c3d4...": {
        "feasibility": 0.9,
        "parallelism": 0.8,
        "completeness": 0.85,
        "risk": 0.2
      },
      "plan-e5f6g7h8...": {
        "feasibility": 0.7,
        "parallelism": 0.6,
        "completeness": 0.9,
        "risk": 0.4
      }
    }
  },
  "signature": "3045..."
}
```

Critic score aggregate formula: `0.30 * feasibility + 0.25 * parallelism + 0.30 * completeness + 0.15 * (1.0 - risk)`.

---
